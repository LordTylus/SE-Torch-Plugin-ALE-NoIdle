### OBSOLETE: Since SE 1.196 no longer needed

### Introduction
Turrets are relatively performance heavy and on huge servers where you have thousands of them, their idle movement alone can eat up a good chunk of your simulation speed.

This small plugin makes sure that all turrets have their idle movement disabled and keep it disabled. 

### Configuration
No configuration needed. Just drop the plugin in your plugin folder and the server will make sure that when a player enables idle movement that it will be disabled again within the next 10 ticks. (maximum 166ms)
